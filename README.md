# [Postmore](https://postmore.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple post-it app with emphasis on frontend. I built this application with React, Redux. I tried to build this app with as few libraries as possible, so I built my own Modal class. I also used media query to enable responsive grid display. Please run "npm install" before running the application. Thank you for your time! :smile:
